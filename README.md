# Learning Algorithms and Data Structures


## Introduction

Welcome to my personal repository for learning algorithms and data structures. This repository is a collection of exercises, notes, and solutions that I am using to improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Exercises

Inside this repository, you will find folders containing exercises on different topics related to algorithms and data structures. These exercises are for my own practice and learning.

These exercises come from the course "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python", taught by Aakash N. S. They can be found (as well as their original course) in the following links:
